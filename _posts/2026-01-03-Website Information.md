As of today (January 3rd 2026) this website is now hosted on github pages. This is a much simpler option and still free since the site is open-source. Before, I was using wordpress, so the website needed a database and in order to host for free, I had a dedicated server. This created many headaches, and the only real benefit was allowing comments on articles, which only resulted in spam anyways.

But for archival purposes, I will include the original post from 2020 here:

My website is what is commonly known as a “LAMP” stack. (Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP)

### Hosting

I am hosting this website myself using a Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian (debian-based OS). It is running Apache as the server backend. I chose to host the website myself to save money, and also to help me learn. 

### Database

The server is running mysql, which is necessary for a WordPress website. 

### Framework

I decided to use WordPress, which is a PHP framework for managing my pages and other content. 

### Cost

Since I host the website myself, I only have to pay for the domain name which is only around $11 per year. Very good deal.
