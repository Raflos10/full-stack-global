The goal with this project was to create a GUI framework for Monogame that easily allowed natural keyboard and mouse input, and made menus easy to build. I took inspiration from the way WPF works, because when I first started learning WPF I found it to be very intuitive.

It uses a grid-based system, so UI elements are positioned and scaled according to their placement within the grid. This makes it easy to quickly build dynamic menus, and also easy for selection using a keyboard or gamepad to function.

Although this project is currently fully functional and ready to be used in games, I would like to someday overhaul it and simplify it since I feel like I have learned a lot since I first started on this project. It could also use additional features like scroll sections, different types of buttons, etc.
