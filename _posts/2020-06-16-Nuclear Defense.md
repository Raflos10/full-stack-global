Nuclear Defense is a combination between a tower defense game and a platformer. [The game can be downloaded here.](https://raflos.itch.io/nuclear-defense)
I created it using [Monogame](https://www.monogame.net/), a game framework based on XNA (Microsoft’s old game framework). 

The game relies heavily on an open-source project of mine called [Intuitive GUI for Monogame.](/game-development/2020/06/16/Intuitive-GUI-for-Monogame.html)

The game uses the .NET framework and is written in C#.
