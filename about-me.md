title: About Me

Hi, my name is Andrew.

If you’re interested in working with me on a project, send me a message on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-fischbeck/).

I made this website in 2017 when I was in university, and since then I’ve had many projects and different software positions.

Recently my primary focus has been on open-source projects, and startup ideas. I’ve been particularly interested in Rust and in backend services like Supabase.

I really hope to work on more projects like this in the future.

Thank you for visiting my very old and dated website.
